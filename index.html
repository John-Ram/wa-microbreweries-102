                <p>Founded by Decended Nord, Jon Oppegaard after turning his ancestral passion into a local business. He brings homemade, high quality mead to your local market. While he may bring may fan favorites like his Oak barrel and Dragon's blood to the table. He uses consistent techniques with minor tweeks to each batch. So while you might pick one you like, no batch is every the same in a good way. And for those special occasions or you just want something unique, he has Limited Run Meads thatare very different and if popular enough may one day become a standard flavor. So come down to Oppegaard Meadery and give them a try!</p>
